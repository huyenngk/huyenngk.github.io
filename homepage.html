    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>My name is Kate. I grew up in Vietnam, but I have lived in the US for 10 years now. I didn't start to fully appreciate Vietnamese food until I came to the US. I live in Indiana where it is very difficult to find authentic Vietnamese food. I missed the food so much that I decided to learn to make it myself.</p>
    <p>To me, cooking is a hobby and a way express care for my loved ones as well as to preserve the Vietnamese tradition in my family. I also find cooking to be a great way to make friends. </p>
    <p>I will use this blog to share my favorite Vietnamese food recipes. I hope you will enjoy it!</p>
